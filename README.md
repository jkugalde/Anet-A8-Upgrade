# Anet A8 Upgrade

I have an Anet A8, it was the cheapest 3d printer in the market around the time that i bought it (2019) and served its purpose well enough, but now with the pandemic lockdown i have enough time to invest in get some major upgrades done. 

This is a work in progress and i currently have only modified the frame, from acrylic to aluminium. I am planning to change the controller to one of the latest with touch screen compatibility, to make and enclosure to reduce heat dissipation and noise and maybe modify the mechanical arrangement to a corexy or something like that.

## Aluminium frame

One of the main weaknesses of the AnetA8 is the acrylyc frame, which is not rigid enough to withstand high speed/torque, brittle, and difficult to enclose. As i had a good time making a table with T-Slots aluminium profiles i thought why not?.

The criteria were:

- To make a box so it would be easier to build and enclose (probably more expensive tho).
- Big enough to fit the Anet parts.
- To use the profiles without cutting them.

I decided to use 30x30 T-Slots as they are cheaper and stronger than 20x20 V-Slots, which are also a good option to make machines too as there are plenty of accesories and also works as transmission system, but i am not going to make any changes in that last topic yet.


As the beams are sold in multiples of 250 mm and the Anet axis are longer than that i chose to use 500 mm profiles in the following design:

There is some space in the bottom to separate the electronics and power from the rest of the machine, wich will be in an enclosure in the future. Unfortunately, there are three of the beams that must be cut to a different length, one of them is to hold the spool up and the other two are will sustain the z motors and define the length of the y axis.

I could have made the y axis longer by simply not cutting these pair of profiles, but then i will have to buy new 8 mm steel rods, belt and bed system, so nah. I am planning to make a corexy anyway.

The foots were going to be the standard rubber foots for 30x30 aluminium profiles, but they need an M5 bolt and the hole in the profiles is bigger than that, so i am using round rubber stoppers with M8 bolts for the moment, until i print something to hold the M5 nut in the foots.
