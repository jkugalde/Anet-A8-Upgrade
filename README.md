# Anet A8 Upgrade

I have an Anet A8, it was the cheapest 3d printer in the market around the time that i bought it (2019) and served its purpose well enough, but now with the pandemic lockdown i have enough time to invest in get some major upgrades done. 

This is a work in progress and i currently have only modified the frame, from acrylic to aluminium. I am planning to change the controller to one of the latest with touch screen compatibility, to make and enclosure to reduce heat dissipation and noise and maybe modify the mechanical arrangement to a corexy or something like that.
